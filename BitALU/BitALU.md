# BitALU

Single bit ALU designed using 2N3904 transistors and 10K resistors. Each board is designed to handle the following operations:

*	Addition
*	Subtraction
*	AND
*	XOR
*	OR
*	NOT
*	Left Shift
*	Right Shift
*	Copy B

The circuit is designed to allow multiple 1 bit ALUs to be chained together to form a full 8-bit ALU. With some additional circuitry the ALU can be used as part of a digital computer.
